DWMIC
=====

DWMIC is a small addon I created some years ago when I played World of Warcraft. I had a problem which consisted of people talking to me while I was in combat and I hadn't been able to answer them. 

The addon I created detected in game when you are in combat and sends an automatic reply which could be personalized to everyone who talk to you. The addon is written in Lua, and had like 500 downloads before I left the game some months after. You can see the statistics in the wiki at CurseForge and the website I launched to show it.

It's a very old project which I did many years ago. So, don't expect it works at first (I don't know which is the current state of WoW's API) or any quality code.
